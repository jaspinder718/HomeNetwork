# HomeNetwork
## Objective
Create a network detailing a department store divided into two separate but connected networks with their own PCs, telephones, and printers. 

## Skills Learned
- Applying separate IP Address ranges to each switch
- Applying unique IP Addresses to each End device
- Configuring the switches and End devices so they all communicate with the Router and each other to create a functioning overall network.

## Tools Used
-Cisco Packet Tracer Software

## Steps 
- Create the overall diagram and put the appropriate router, switches, and end devices on the diagram.
- Configure each separate item by applying the IP Address that is within the range of the given switch which ultimately can connect to the router as well as the other switch from the other department.
- Connect End devices to the switches using appropriate cabling which will allow both to connect. Also, connecting the appropriate cabling to connect the switch to the router will allow internet access and connection between the entire network.
